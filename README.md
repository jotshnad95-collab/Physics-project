# Physics-project
This project visualizes the concept of young's double slit experiment and the theory of quantum eraser.

# ABOUT:
This repositry contains my first semester physics project created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Users can adjust physical parameters like wavelength and slit separation, and the output graph dynamically shows the interference pattern, demonstrating wave–particle duality and the quantum eraser effect.

# Contents:
index.html--
This file defines the structure and content of the quantum double-slit simulation webpage. It organizes the splash screen, instruction pages, and simulation interface, and links the external CSS and JavaScript files required for styling, interactivity, and dynamic visualization of the experiment.

quantum_glitch.css--
This file controls the visual appearance of the project. It defines colors, fonts, layouts, animations, and responsive elements, creating a neon-themed scientific interface that enhances user experience and clearly presents the simulation controls and results.

quantum_glitch.js--
This file manages the logic and interactivity of the simulation. It handles page transitions, user input from sliders and dropdowns, performs interference pattern calculations, and dynamically renders graphs using the Plotly library.

# Functions or libraries used:
This project uses Plotly.js for dynamic graph visualization and Google Fonts for improved typography. Core JavaScript functionality relies on the browser DOM API to handle user interaction, page navigation, and real-time updates. Key functions include event listeners, custom interference calculations, and dynamic rendering of graphs based on simulation parameters.
